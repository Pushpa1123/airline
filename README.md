# Airline Booking Contract

This repository contains the source code for a Solidity smart contract named `AirlineBookingContract`, which facilitates flight bookings on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Overview

The `AirlineBookingContract` contract enables users to book flights by associating a passenger's address with a given flight number. It also provides functionality to cancel existing flight bookings.

### Features

- **Flight Booking**: Users can book flights by specifying the flight number. Once booked, the passenger's address is associated with the flight.
  
- **Flight Cancellation**: Passengers or the airline can cancel flight bookings, freeing up the seat for other passengers.

### Events

The contract emits two events:

1. `FlightBooked`: Triggered when a passenger successfully books a flight.
2. `FlightCanceled`: Triggered when a flight booking is canceled.

## Smart Contract Security

While this contract provides basic functionalities for airline booking management, it's essential to conduct thorough testing and auditing before deploying it to the Ethereum mainnet. Potential security considerations include ensuring proper authorization controls, handling of edge cases, and protection against common attack vectors such as reentrancy and integer overflow/underflow.
